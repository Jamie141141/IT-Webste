	<div>To remove a virus from your PC, follow these general steps:

		1) Disconnect from the internet: Unplug the network cable or disable Wi-Fi to prevent the virus from spreading or downloading additional malicious files.
		
		2) Enter Safe Mode: Restart your computer and enter Safe Mode. This mode only loads essential system files and disables most startup programs, making it easier to identify and remove the virus. The method to enter Safe Mode may vary depending on your operating system.
		
		3) Update your antivirus software: If you have an antivirus program installed, ensure it's up to date with the latest virus definitions. If you don't have one, consider installing reputable antivirus software.
		
		4) Run a full system scan: Perform a thorough scan of your entire system using your antivirus software. Allow the software to quarantine or remove any detected viruses or malware.
		
		5) Use specialized virus removal tools: In addition to your antivirus software, you may need specialized tools to target specific types of viruses or malware. Research and download reputable tools designed to remove the specific virus you're dealing with.
		
		6) Delete temporary files: Viruses often hide in temporary files. Use the Disk Cleanup tool or manually delete temporary files from your system to eliminate potential hiding places for the virus.
		
		7) Review recently installed programs: Check the list of recently installed programs and uninstall any suspicious or unfamiliar software. Viruses sometimes disguise themselves as legitimate programs.
		
		8) Update your operating system and software: Ensure your operating system, web browsers, and other software are up to date with the latest security patches. This helps protect against known vulnerabilities that viruses may exploit.
		
		9) Change passwords: If you suspect that your passwords have been compromised, change them for all your accounts, especially for online banking, email, and social media.
		
		10) Educate yourself and practice safe browsing: Learn about safe browsing habits, such as avoiding suspicious websites, not opening email attachments from unknown sources, and being cautious when downloading files from the internet.
		
		11) Reconnect to the internet and monitor: After completing the virus removal process, reconnect to the internet and monitor your system for any unusual behavior or signs of reinfection. Run periodic scans with your antivirus software to ensure your system remains clean.</div>
